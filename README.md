# STL_C
## Overview

**STL_C** is a C Project inspired by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). It provides generic data structures and algorithms for C programmers, aiming to improve productivity and code quality.

## Features

- Generic containers (vector, stack, queue, etc.)
- Iterators for container traversal
- Common algorithms (sort, search, etc.)
- Memory management utilities
- Type-safe interfaces using macros

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/himanshugaura/STL_C.git
    ```
2. Include the headers in your C project:
    ```c
    #include "stl_vector.h"
    #include "stl_list.h"
    // etc.
    ```
3. Build your project as usual.
